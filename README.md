## Opening the project in NetBeans
You need Gradle to open the project. If you don't have it, here's how to get it:
- In NetBeans, go to Tools > Plugins.
- In the Available Plugins tab, search for Gradle Support.
- Select it and install.
- Now you can open the project file.

Remember, when running the project, you must run the desktop subproject. The core subproject cannot be run directly.
