# WGE3
A 2D top-down action game currently in development, heavily influenced by the likes of [WGE2](http://arisuonpaa.com/veryold/wge2.php) and [Tapan Kaikki](http://news.bigdownload.com/2009/04/03/freeware-friday-tapan-kaikki-bloodshed/). Written in Java using the [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) game development framework.

## Opening the project in NetBeans
You need Gradle to open the project. If you don't have it, here's how to get it:
- In NetBeans, go to Tools > Plugins.
- In the Available Plugins tab, search for Gradle Support.
- Select it and install.
- Now you can open the project file.

[Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) is also required to compile the project.

To run the project, you must run the `desktop` subproject. The `core` subproject cannot be run directly.
